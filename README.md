Create an issue in the repo (not sure it works for everyone?) with a LCSC part id (e.g. C1005) or multiple (C1005,C1006,C1007), wait for the github action to complete. The repo is updated with library files and an updated db.sqlite3, so when you pull it (and add the symbol in kicad), new parts show up in kicad.

Using this work to get LCSC part catalog:

and this one to pull converted library files:
